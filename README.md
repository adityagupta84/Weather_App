# Weather App 🌤️
Hey there! Welcome to my Weather App – your go-to spot for checking the weather in any city around the world. 
Whether you want to see the current weather, hourly updates, or the five-day forecast, I've got you covered!

## 🌐 Try It Out!
Check out the live version here: (https://adityagupta84-weather-app.netlify.app/)

## 🌟 Features
Real-Time Weather Updates: Get up-to-the-minute weather data, including the current temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, and a quick weather description.

Five-Day Forecast: Wondering if it’ll be sunny for the weekend? Check out the five-day forecast with daily highs and lows.

Hourly Forecast: Planning your day? See how the temperature changes hour by hour.

Search by City: Type in any city, and boom! You get the weather details.

Automatic Location Detection: Too lazy to search? No problem! The app detects your current location and shows you the weather.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

Here's what I used to build this app:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: For building the frontend.

OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching real-time weather data.

Vite: For faster development and optimized build process.

## 📚 How It Works

Fetching Weather Data: When you search for a city, the app reaches out to the OpenWeatherMap API and grabs the latest weather details.

Hourly & Five-Day Forecast: It then serves you an easy-to-digest forecast for the next few hours and days.

## 🛠️ What's Next?

Here are a few things I'm thinking of adding:

Smoother animations and transitions to make the experience even more enjoyable.

More weather details like wind speed, air pressure, and sunrise/sunset times.

Letting you switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit (because, why not?).
